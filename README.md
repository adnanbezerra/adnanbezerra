# A small biography:
Hello, my name is Adnan Medeiros Bezerra! I am a 19 years old Computer Science student at Federal University of Campina
Grande who's currently living in Paraíba, Brazil. I am a devout Catholic, I enjoy musics, playing chess, studying 
philosphy, history, mathematics and theology (besides informatics, of course), and I also love to make new friends. 

# What have I done in my life?
I have been programming in Java for about seven months already. I also do have some experience with JavaScript, MySQL and Python,
and soon I will start to study Web Development seriously. Currently, I can speak Portuguese, English, Spanish and a little bit
of Italian and Latin, looking forward to widening the list. At this moment, I'm working as a text writer at Livraria Caritatem,
creating content related to Catholicism. I'm also working on a CNPq project at NITT@UFCG.

# What are my goals in life?
As every single devout Catholic should do, my main goal is to become a saint through my vocation. Because of that, I want 
to work as a Web Developer. I also want to stablish a family, become a father and to ensure that my children will join their
voices with mine by proclaiming the sacred words: Viva Cristo Rey!
